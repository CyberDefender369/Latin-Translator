# Latin Translator


# Description 
This project will make use of strings, conditional flow, data structures, and for loops to create an imaginary language that will be called pig latin. Essentially, the program converts the user entered sentence into pig latin. Pig latin moves the first few consonants of a word to the end and adds "ay." If the word starts with a vowel, then "yay" is added to the end of the word.
