# Latin Translator


# Description 
This project makes use of string slicing, string concatenation, string methods, conditional flow, data structures, and for loops to create an imaginary language that will be called pig latin. The program converts the user entered sentence into pig latin. Pig latin moves the first few consonants of a word to the end and adds "ay." If the word starts with a vowel, then "yay" is added to the end of the word. Put simply, every word starts with a vowel in pig latin.


# Language and Utilities Used

- Python 3.10.11
- Thonny 4.1.3

# Environments Used 

- Windows 11


# Notes
This program does not account for question marks, commas, or any other punctuation marks. If the user enters a sentence with any type of punctuation mark, the program does not behave as intended. To fix this, one would have to slice out the punctuation mark and reinsert it in the appropriate place.
