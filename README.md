# Pig Latin Translator


# Description 
This Python project combines various programming techniques, including string manipulation (slicing, concatenation, and methods), conditional flow, data structures, and for loops. The goal is to create a Pig Latin converter—an imaginary language transformation tool. When given a user-entered sentence, the program converts it into Pig Latin. In Pig Latin, consonants from the beginning of a word are moved to the end, followed by the addition of “ay.” If a word starts with a vowel, “yay” is appended to the end. In essence, every word begins with a vowel in Pig Latin.
